The goal of html2builder is to take HTML (say from a designer) and
automatically turn it into Markaby or Nokogiri Builder style Ruby
for use as a template. Use cases may be to take an initial
design of a site from a designer and quickly get an initial
template, to "reverse engineer" a template in another template
language via the HTML etc.

Ideally it will also recognize some patterns, such as lists,
and turn it into arrays or arrays of structs that can then be
replaced with models.
